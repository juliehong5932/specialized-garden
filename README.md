This website was created to help people find the best plants for them depending on what they are looking for from answering 6 questions. 


You can choose from State, Season, Plant Type,Sun Needs, Soil Needs and features. 
You can also hover over the graphs under the visuals page and find a plant name, plant type and season by hovering the graph.
